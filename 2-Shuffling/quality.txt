Explanation:
From the results of the simulation, it appears to be enough to riffle shuffle a deck 7 times to
achieve a 2 decimal place accuracy. Any more shuffling and the quality only oscillates between
an Â± 0.01 average. Any less shuffling and the quality shows a slight tendency to converge slightly
above the 0.5 mark.
